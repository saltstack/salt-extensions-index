Description
-----------

salt-cumulus
============

Salt-cumulus is a small salt state, providing an easy way to configure the configuration of a cumulus switch.

It provides a simple interface to apply ``net`` commands from a template.

It does not provide anything else for the moment. Most of others changes can be done via usual salt states.

This is a **beta version**. Use it at your own risk!

Installation
------------

Simply run the following command on your switch:

``pip install salt-cumulus``

Usage
-----

You can use in your sls files the following state:

.. code-block::

   test_config:
       cumulus.managed:
         - source: salt://config

Assuming the config file look like:

.. code-block::

   net add time ntp server ch.pool.ntp.org

The state will parse the lines in your templated file and run each command starting with ``net add`` or ``net del``. Others elements are ignored, so you may add comments or other data as you like, but we suggest you starts comments with ``#``.

**Warning**

Running this state will abort any pending configuration first: you should avoid using the ``net`` command at the same time!
